Arduino based Women Safety System using GSM module with emergency calling and RGB LED indication
# 🚨 Women Safety System using GSM and Arduino

## 📌 Project Description
This project is designed to improve women safety by enabling emergency calling
using a GSM module. By pressing dedicated buttons, calls are automatically made
to pre-registered phone numbers.

An RGB LED provides visual indication for different actions.

This project was developed as part of my Robotics Trainer internship at LEAP Robots.
